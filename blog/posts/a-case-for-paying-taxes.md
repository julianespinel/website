# A case for paying taxes

Taxes are unavoidable, that should be clear to you and to everyone who lives on planet Earth right now. However, I can relate to you if you are not happy about paying taxes because you think your money is not used wisely or it is stolen by corrupt politicians. I was born in a country in South America and it was clear to me and to most people living there that our taxes were not used for the correct purposes. Now I'm living in Europe and I am more than happy to pay taxes here. Why? Simple, it is evident that taxes are used for the benefit of society as a whole, and not to benefit a few that already have more than they need.

Living here has changed my opinon around paying taxes. I can see that taxes are important to distribute wealth and to provide social security for everyone. I'm happy to know that the money I'm contributing every month to the welfare system...

However I can relate if you are not happy about paying taxes if you live in a country where politicians steal taxpayers money. I was born in a country in South America.
